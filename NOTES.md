# Algolia Frontend Validator - Development Notes

## 🎯 Current Status (Latest Push: 2b46baa)

### ✅ What's Working
- **Extension builds successfully** with Vite + CRXJS
- **DevTools panel loads** and connects to background script
- **Network traffic detection** via Chrome debugger API
- **Card-based UI** for Live Traffic (replaced table design)
- **Batch grouping** with visual connectors for multi-query requests
- **Traffic hierarchy** - events nested under searches
- **Query parsing** - human-readable search queries instead of raw JSON
- **Testing framework** - Jest setup with traffic grouping tests
- **Code structure** - clean separation of concerns with utils

### 🚨 Known Issues
1. **Sorting is backwards** - searches showing oldest to newest instead of newest to oldest
2. **Blue line visual issues** - may still have some styling problems
3. **Timestamp debugging** - added console logs to investigate sorting

### 🔧 Recent Fixes Applied
- **Timestamp capture** - background script now captures real request time
- **Data flow** - timestamps flow from background → DevTools → parsers
- **Request parsing** - uses actual request time instead of parse time
- **UI redesign** - complete overhaul from table to cards

---

## 🚀 Next Session Priorities

### 1. **Fix Sorting Issue (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- **Problem**: Searches displaying oldest to newest
- **Debug Steps**:
  - Check browser console for timestamp debug logs
  - Verify timestamps are actually different between requests
  - Confirm traffic grouping utility is receiving correct data
- **Potential Solutions**:
  - Fix timestamp capture if all timestamps are the same
  - Fix sorting logic if timestamps are correct
  - Check if data is being processed in wrong order

### 2. **Test UI with Real Traffic (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- **Goal**: Verify new card-based design works with actual Algolia requests
- **Test Cases**:
  - Single search requests
  - Multi-search batch requests
  - Click/conversion events
  - Events with and without QueryID
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Searches appear newest first
  - Events nested under parent searches
  - Batch groups show visual connectors
  - Cards expand/collapse properly

### 3. **Polish Visual Design (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- **Blue line styling** - ensure clean, consistent appearance
- **Card spacing** - verify consistent margins and padding
- **Status badges** - refine "No Query ID" vs "Valid" styling
- **Typography** - ensure readability in DevTools panel

### 4. **Remove Debug Logging (LOW PRIORITY)**
- **Clean up** console.log statements in traffic-grouping.ts
- **Remove** temporary debugging code
- **Optimize** for production

## 📝 Session Notes

### Session 1 (Today)
- ✅ Major UI redesign from table to cards
- ✅ Implemented batch grouping with visual connectors
- ✅ Fixed timestamp capture in background script
- ✅ Added comprehensive testing framework
- 🚨 Identified sorting issue (oldest to newest)
- 🔧 Added debug logging to investigate

### Next Session Goals
1. **Fix sorting** - highest priority
2. **Test with real traffic** - verify functionality
3. **Polish UI** - clean up visual issues
4. **Remove debug code** - production ready

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The extension is ready for production when:
- [ ] Searches display newest to oldest correctly
- [ ] Events are properly nested under searches
- [ ] Batch grouping shows clear visual hierarchy
- [ ] UI is clean and consistent
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No console errors in production build
- [ ] Performance is acceptable in DevTools panel
